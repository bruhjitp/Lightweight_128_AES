AES is a very important hardware module considering present need for data security at hardware level.
https://github.com/michaelehab has a  basic AES module repo designed, a great work indeed.

I took the work and made it lightweight by reducing LUT utilisation by a whooping 68.77%, ie 2921LUTs.
The design also improved speed of the system by some margin, improving it from 25.05MHz to 41.13MHz.

Further works are being done to improve the speed and replicate similar results in the decryption module.
